This time, like all the semester endings, I have a lot of ideas and plans in mind and I hope to complete at least some of them if not all. Last vacation I looked into the Rust book and this holidays I want to try making a project in rust.<p>The other thing is that I switched from Fedora to NixOS, the Nix language and the OS's declerativeness has gotten me interested in Haskell and functional paradigm in general. Also, lambda calculus, currying, monads and other concepts originated from functional paradigm are very interesting.<p>I hope to learn something flashy✨, something technical⚙ and something unique❄️ this holiday.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-08-14/>GitHub Field Day</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-08-14</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I like the initiative by GitHub to bring like-minded people of tech in a single place by organising un-conferences around the globe. On one hand, I am excited to meet people like me but on the other hand, it's GitHub(Microsoft) whose product I will become as the saying goes "If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product".<p>Anyways, meeting my people is more important and about being a product, that should be handled strategically. I'll try to include other git hosting platforms like gitlab, codeberg and forgejo whenever I say the word GitHub, think that's more healthy.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-07-27/>research::map</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-07-24</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I created a new section called <a href=https://map.scientiac.space>map.scientiac.space</a> to keep track of researches and notes I create throughout my journey in the tech world. It's integrated with my obsidian workflow so, I can easily put in and out the things I want to track which is sooo cool!</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-06-13/>Mental Liquidity</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-06-13</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I came across a <a href=https://collabfund.com/blog/mental-liquidity/>blog</a> post about Mental Liquidity, and it got me into thinking how people do not want to change their mind, especially when it comes to generationally gapped individuals. One's beliefs can be drastically different from the other and yet none would listen to the other and look at it from their perspective as well. Humans have evolved learning things and passing the technique that helped them survive to the new generation, so it isn't a big deal to assume that they survived fine with those beliefs, and it is far optimal to pass on that belief than to gamble with new opinions.<p>Anyway, I hope it doesn't just remain as a new term in my vocabulary. I believe that one should be able to change their mind on things, change my mind!</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-05-03/>Officially a Space Explorer</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-05-03</code><div class=syndicate-text><center> <p><strong>Domain</strong><br> <code>dō-mān′</code></p> </center><ol><li>A territory over which rule or control is exercised.<li>A sphere of activity, influence, or knowledge: synonym: field.<li>The set of all possible values of an independent variable of a function.<li>An open connected set that contains at least one point.</ol><p>Yep!

Yuck!</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-05-02</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>Gnome is officially out of the system now. I loved it but I love hyprland better now. Anyways, the consistency with GTK apps was what I liked about it and the essence of that still remains in hyprland with EWW which is configured in yuck, hence the title.<p>EWW works as almost all the things, but some standalone apps are still better to have, so I have used swaync as the notification daemon and rofi-wayland as the launcher. Overall the system is pretty usable now, and I just love hyprland's animations.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-04-30/>Chapter Two: Sophomore</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-04-30</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>Yes! The freshman year is over now. And I already feel like I have more responsibilities than usual. It feels good for some time until the feeling that you're getting old hits you. This year passed with a blink of an eye, I remember getting inside the college and feeling exited about what I was going to be. Let's see how the life as a middle child in the college goes. Wow! Three more binks and I'll be a graduate, it's scary.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-04-29-second/>Exponential Fluctuations</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-04-29</code><div class=syndicate-text><center> <p>Sometimes It's the end of the world,<br> sometimes MEH!

Yeah! Yeah! This is one of those hot takes on "Love" ooOooh!!<p>Human nature is weird. Like, how someone would behave when they feel like they're loved and how the behavior would change when they feel like they are indifferent to them. It's quite fascinating that the behavioral and psychological pattern change, how cute turns into offensive and feelings turn into conscious infatuation. Apparently hope plays quite a big role in it. One could argue that "love" is nothing but just hopefulness. And when one gets hopeless, everybody knows how that goes.<p>This is neither a paper nor a thesis, it's just my take on love today. So, I suppose it's better incomplete and a hot take than a "WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS TRUE" of a vibe. Bye!</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-04-28/>Some Fleabag</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-04-28</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I kinda binged fleabag and it was quite awesome. It's more of a six-hour movie than a show, I'd say. I had watched season 1 and season 2 wasn't difficult to finish. This is one of those series which I hated the first season, and it made my mind with the second. It's a masterpiece as it ended with an actual ending and wasn't extended due to public demand or just money.<p>Yeah! The fact that it ended is my second favorite thing about the show.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-04-27/>Continuing the Redesign</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-04-27</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I made link previews, made logo dynamic with color changes, stylized POSSE views and little improvements like: isolating readable.css and improving the paginator layout.<p>And talking about my achievement today, I unlocked a pimple on my face due to sleeplessness.
